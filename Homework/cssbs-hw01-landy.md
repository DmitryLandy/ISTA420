**1. What is a console app?**

- Console Apps are apps that use the command prompt instead of a GUI.

**2. List two differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core. Note that in this class, we will be writing C# applications in .NET Framework and ASP.NET applications in NET Core.**

**4. Describe these three files: TextHello.sln, TextHello.csproj, and AssemblyInfo.cs.**
- .sln is the solution file for the program that helps organize the projects
- .csproj is a project file that references one or more files containing the source code.
- AssemblyInfo.cs is the c# source code that contains information about the assembly (such as name, version, etc.)

**5. What is the purpose of a namespace?**
- They are containers that help avoid name-clashing issues for items such as classes.

**6. Describe specifically what using statements does.**

**10. What is the relationship between an assembly and a namespace?**
- none

**11. What is a graphical app?**
- It is an applications that provides a graphical user interface (GUI).

**12. What does ```Build``` do?**
- Compiles and saves the code

**13. (Not in book) What is bytecode? What is Microsoft CIL? Do you think that CIL is bytecode? Why or why not?**
- Bytecode is the compiled code that the computer runs. CIL is the bytecode language for the .NET framework.
